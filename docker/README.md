# Steps to build

1. **Checkout the OpenJDK source code** - e.g. `git clone git@github.com:AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u.git ~/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u`
1. **Choose the version platform** - e.g. `cd jdk8/x86_64/ubuntu/`
1. **Create the docker image** - e.g. `docker build -t dockeropenjdk .` 
1. **Run the build** - `docker run -it -v <path to source>:/openjdk/build dockeropenjdk`. 
1. **See the results** - Take a look at the results in the build directory

Optionally you can run with Debug (to shell): 

`docker run -it -v <path to source>:/openjdk/build --entrypoint /bin/bash dockeropenjdk`
